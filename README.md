# Natural Disasters
This project uses an LSTM model for natural language processing to predict whether a tweet is about a natural disaster. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled tweets.

# Requirements
This project requires Python 3.7 or later, as well as several Python libraries, including:

pandas
numpy
nltk
logzero
keras
sklearn
You can install these libraries using pip or another package manager.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries using pip or another package manager.

Open the natural_disasters.yaml file and update the file paths to match your local file system.

Run the '#NaturalDisasters' class in the natural_disasters.py file to preprocess the data, build the model, train the model, and make predictions.
